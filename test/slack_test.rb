# Any tests involving a User should use the username SlackBot
# Any tests involving a Channel should use the #random channel

# Do not need to test your main command loop, or the user interaction portions of your app.
# However, all classes and helper methods should be thoroughly tested. Here are some tips:
# Follow TDD best practices (pseudocode, red, green, refactor)
# Add tests for all code you write
# Make sure all tests are green before pushing to GitHub
# Make sure all tests are green after you pull
